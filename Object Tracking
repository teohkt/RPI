#Testing out the Camera

I got errors from cv2.videocapture(0), 'VIDEOIO ERROR: V4L: can't open camera by index 0'. I tried changing to videocapture(-1), but then the error message was 'can't find camera device. The solution was to allow permissions to access the camera (ontop of Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration)

sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2

I got errors from import cv2, 'ImportError: No module named 'cv2' although when I tested it in terminal, I could import cv2. Turns out, cv2.so needs to be exactly in /usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/. You can gain root permission through 

gksudo pcmanfm

to capture an image:

raspistill -o output.jpg

Captured an image of the box for the GPIO breakout board & Ribbon cable for Raspberry Pi.
Uploaded image to colorcodepicker.com ti find the RBG code on the yellow portion. This returned 195, 149, 14

After running python3 bgr_hsv_converter.py 195 149 14

Output:
Lower bound is:
